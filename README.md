## description
4 BPM counters are connected to each other and their values are in sync, until one of them gets a new value. Once this happens, the other 3 counters follow its lead and synchronize once again over a specific period of time (approx. 1:40 min) and reach a new equilibrium (faster BPM). This process is similar to sync of metronomes on a platform.

Each of he BPM counters is assigned 2 sequencers with a note on MIDI output.
